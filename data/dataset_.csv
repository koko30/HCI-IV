TikTok Ban debate,Government,"Congress frames TikTok and other apps controlled by “foreign adversaries” as a serious and urgent threat to the United States. This report points out the possibility that the Chinese government can compel ByteDance to provide access to extensive U.S. user data under PRC intelligence laws. Lawmakers stress that TikTok’s data collection, algorithmic control, and content-shaping capabilities potentially manipulate American public opinion and affect political discourse. This report also highlights the shortcomings of other alternative proposals, such as Project Texas, because TikTok’s source code, backend engineering, and algorithmic operations would remain in China. Overall, this report frames TikTok as a high-risk platform that requires statutory action to prevent foreign adversary control.",,"Congress

It’s a beautiful app, it’s brought so many people together, it’s changed a lot of people’s lives, and for it to just be taken away like that feels ... so not American.
On TikTok I’ve just been able to find that audience so much easier,
It kind of seems like Biden’s kind of pushing it off to Trump, she said. “So people have hopes that maybe we have a few more days and it won’t go dark on Sunday, but I don’t really know.
Up until today, I was extremely optimistic. And after today’s Supreme Court decision to uphold the ban or the sale of TikTok, I weigh my options, he said. But honestly, it’s very disheartening, specifically because I truly did rely on the app for my business and my growth of my business.
It’s kind of like they keep putting the ball in each other’s court, but who’s going to make the decision?he said. He said small business owners are told to be creative, pull yourself up by the bootstraps,” he said. And a lot of people did that, and it’s like those bootstraps are being cut now.

It defines the risk primarily through large-scale data collection, arguing that sensitive personal and proprietary information could be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party and used for surveillance, blackmail, and corporate espionage.
The order further frames content moderation and information control as security threats, warning that politically sensitive censorship and potential disinformation campaigns could undermine democratic values and public trust.
By citing prior bans by U.S. federal agencies, the Indian government, and American organizations, the document legitimizes aggressive state intervention and positions decisive executive action as necessary to protect national interests and secure the information and communications technology supply chain.",,"national emergency
